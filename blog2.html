    <h2>Where I can run my HTML program?</h2>
    <p>HTML Development can be done in either TEXT editors or IDEs. If you have windows OS then you can write your code in Notepad and run it on in your any browser. it gives you output.</p>

    <h3>Examples of various text editors to run HTML</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Notepad in Windows</li>
        <li>TextEdit in Mac</li>
        <li>vi editor in Linux</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Alternatively you can download advanced editors like Sublime Text or Notepad++. You can search for them in your search engine and go to the download page.</p>
    <p>When you use a Text editor, just create a new file, and add your HTML Code.</p>
    <p>Once added, save the file to your favorite location. Make sure to save with extension ".html".</p>
    <p>You are done! Go to the location where you saved the file and double click the file to see the HTML Output.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Visual Studio</li>
        <li>Eclipse IDE</li>
